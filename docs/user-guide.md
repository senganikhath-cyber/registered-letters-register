# User Guide

This small app lets you record registered letters locally in your browser.

## Adding a letter

1. Fill in the recipient name, address, date sent and tracking number in the "Add a New Registered Letter" form.
2. Click "Add Letter". The letter will appear in the table and is stored in your browser's localStorage.

## Deleting a letter

Click the "Delete" button for a letter to remove it from the list.

## Notes

- Data is stored locally in your browser. Clearing your browser data will remove saved letters.
- This is a minimal static implementation intended as a starting point. For production use consider adding server-side storage, validation and export/import features.
